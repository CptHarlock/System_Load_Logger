System_Load_Logger
==================

A Bash shell script that will log process information if the system is heavily loaded. The logging path is 
"/home/USER/log/2013-04/load-03.log" and the format is "2013-04-03 10:23:26 19518 soffice.bin 75.3"
The script does this task once. Then it could then be set up as a cron job to run regularly
